# Internal Alpha Checklist — Mentorino RC2.6

## Pre-Flight

### Environment
- [ ] `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` set to staging project
- [ ] `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` set to staging project anon key
- [ ] Supabase Email/Password auth provider enabled
- [ ] Email confirmation disabled (or confirmation flow implemented)
- [ ] Password reset redirect URL configured

### Edge Function Secrets
- [ ] `SUPABASE_URL` set
- [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` set
- [ ] `RESEND_API_KEY` set (Resend API key obtained and verified)

### Database

- [ ] Realtime publication enabled on `messages`, `notifications`, `sessions`, `bookings`
- [ ] Storage buckets created (profile-avatars, student-documents, mentor-resources, gallery-images)
- [ ] Storage RLS policies applied

## Security Gates (Must Fix Before Alpha)

### Critical
- [ ] `scheduled/index.ts` — CRON_SECRET verification implemented (not relying on Authorization header alone)
- [ ] `resend/index.ts` — role validation added (only mentors can send emails)

### High
- [ ] `profiles.mentor_id` storage policy fixed — use program_enrollments → programs join
- [ ] `tempPassword` removed from `approveApplication` return value

- [ ] Edge function role validation — at minimum for gemini/index.ts

### Medium
- [ ] Mentor SELECT on applications scoped to their own program
